# Fake-News-Detection-Whatsapp-Bot

“Fake news” is a term that has come to mean different things to different people. At its core, we are defining
“fake news” as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources
or quotes. Sometimes these stories may be propaganda that is intentionally designed to mislead the reader, or
may be designed as “clickbait” written for economic incentives (the writer profits on the number of people
who click on the story). In recent years, fake news stories have proliferated via social media, in part because
they are so easily and quickly shared online.
Fake news is an invention – a lie created out of nothing – that takes the appearance of real news with the aim
of deceiving people. This is what is important to remember: the information is false, but it seems true.
